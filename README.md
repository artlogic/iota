# iota

A minimal jekyll theme.

## Guidelines

* Posts and pages should not include H1 tags
* License information in _config.yml is not escaped when emitted.

## To Do

### Short Term

* Figure out where site author information goes - in the footer?

### Long Term

* Remove the compose and html-proofer plugins (just used for testing)
* Package as a Jekyll 3.2 theme
* Rename the repo? iota-theme? jekyll-iota? jekyll-iota-theme?
* Aria roles?
